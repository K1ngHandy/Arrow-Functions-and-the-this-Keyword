        multiply: (a, b) => a * b * this.multiplier;

    PROBLEM 2: Change the arrow function called calculateTotal to work within the flock object below while also using the 'this' keyword. Console.log the calculateTotal method to see the results printed to the console.

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): This object contains a value property and a double method that multiplies the value by 2. When invoking the double method, you receive the error: 'NaN' (Not a Number). Fix the code below and console.log the double method to see the correct result printed to the console.
